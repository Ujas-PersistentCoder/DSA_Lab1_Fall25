# Lab 1 Solutions - Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)  
**Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar (IITGN) - Fall Semester 2025-26**

This repository contains C language solutions to the Lab 1 problems from the DSA course at IITGN. The problems cover permutations, backtracking, and classic algorithmic puzzles such as Sudoku and the Knight's Closed Tour.

## Problems Solved

- **Permutation Index**  
  Compute the lexicographical index of a given permutation.

- **Lexicographical Comparison**  
  Compare two permutations lexicographically.

- **Previous Permutation**  
  Find the lexicographically previous permutation of a sequence.

- **Exact Permutation**  
  Generate or verify a permutation matching specific criteria.

- **Knight's Closed Tour**  
  Find a closed knightâ€™s tour on a chessboard using backtracking.

- **Sudoku Solver**  
  Solve Sudoku puzzles using backtracking algorithms.

## Features

- Well-structured and commented C code (used GPT to comment these ðŸ˜…).  
- Efficient backtracking implementations for complex puzzles.  
- Covers important algorithmic techniques including permutations and graph traversal.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iitgn-dsa-lab1.git
   cd iitgn-dsa-lab1
2. Compile the C program for the problem you want to run. For example:
   ```bash
   gcc sudoku_solver.c -o sudoku_solver
   ./sudoku_solver
   
Requirements
GCC or any standard C compiler.
